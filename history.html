      The ESTAR lab has tags for collecting biological data and kinematic data 
      off of cetaceans (dolphins, whales, etc). I develop the hardware and the 
      data processing tools for these tags. During my time here I've worked 
      on a few different things.
      <br><br>
      One of the goals is to make the tags completely sealed, to protect from saltwater.
      This means three things - wireless charging, WiFi communication, and over-the-air
      firmware updates. This past summer I've implemented wireless charging using the 
      TI BQ51013 chip, and designed a daughter board for the main board inside our tags.
      <br><br>
      We also have various types of tags, and I developed a standardized procedure to verify
      each tag's kinematic data, along with data processing tools to go along with it. Our tags also drift
      at different rates over time, and the data processing tools are also able to characterize sensor 
      drift. This resulted in one massive data processing pipeline that calibrates data,
      sychronizes multiple tags, calculates drift, and plots whatever the user wants, written in MATLAB.
      I documented all of the code and every single procedure. 
      We sent this pipeline over to collaborators and they have successfully used it to verify the tags that
      we have lent them.

      For the EECS 373 final project my ground built a glove that was able to 
      emulate a mouse. We used flex sensors on each finger to simulate different buttons
      on the mouse. An IMU was used for mouse movement, with quaternions to prevent gimbal
      locking. Data from the glove was transmitted to the laptop through serial over 
      XBee modules. We used the C++ Xlib library to control the cursor on the laptop.

        Systems Integration Intern
      </div>
      <a href="https://vayuaerospace.com/">Vayu Aerospace</a>
      <br><br>
      I spent a semester and a summer interning at an Aerospace startup that builds drones. 
      <br><br>
      My main project was to write and test the software that would set off flashbangs 
      being carried by an octocopter. Our microcontroller was an STM32 F1 chip. The software 
      was structured as a state machine that had a boot sequence and an arm/disarm procedure. 
      The system would take in commands from the RC controller, and use that information to 
      trigger the flashbangs. There were a lot of potential risks, so after every change to 
      the software significant testing was done to verify that flashbangs would not be going 
      off accidentally. I worked with other engineers to design a comprehensive test procedure. 
      <br><br>
      One significant challenge that I faced during this was debugging the PCB. The PCBs 
      had just arrived, and we had one week to integrate everything together for a coming 
      trade show. It was a five layer PCB designed by a third party, so an electrical 
      engineering intern and I had to familiarize ourselves with the schematic and layout. 
      And as expected, it didn’t work. What made this difficult was the signals that 
      triggered the flashbangs had to go through a complicated sequence of logic gates 
      as a further precaution against accidental explosions. The flashbangs weren’t being 
      set off when they should be. We spent a lot of time figuring out if it was a hardware 
      or software problem. I wrote the software on a development board, so I was not 
      completely confident. We tested every single combination of the logic gate inputs.
      We found a few bugs - there was one logic gate that had an incorrect pin mapping, 
      another pin was meant to be tied to ground, and there was a via that did not connect 
      the top and bottom layers when it was supposed to. We just barely got it working on 
      Friday at 6 pm before the trade show on Saturday. Our boss sent us a video of the 
      flashbangs working at the trade show that weekend.
      <br><br>
      The PCB had very few breakout pins and was incredibly hard to debug. Further into 
      my internship I built a GUI that reads serial data coming out of the microcontroller 
      and displays it nicely. There were ~50 parameters that were useful for debugging and 
      this helped a lot. If I had more time during the summer I was considering adding a 
      way for the user to change system parameters through the GUI, instead of having 
      to learn how to flash the code each time.
      <br><br>
      One thing that I grew in here was project documentation. As the summer wrapped up,
      I was tasked with making sure one of the new engineers (converted from intern) understood 
      how to use the system, and how to maintain it. I realized that the project that I had 
      so intimately worked with for the past 6 months was not very familiar to anyone else. 
      After introducing the new engineer to the project, we ended up working together to write
      up a detailed document containing things like how the system works, how to update the software, 
      and a thorough testing procedure.

      <a href="https://www.birds.eecs.umich.edu/">BIRDS Lab</a>
      <br><br>
      I worked under Professor Shai Revzen at the Biologically Inspired Robotics and Dynamical 
      Systems (BIRDS) Lab. The main area of study of our lab is legged locomotion. 
      <br><br>
      My first project was to 3D motion capture data on our hopping robot using Qualysis.
      The math involved in this is beyond me, but the experiment required each leg of the robot
      to have a different spring constant. Because of that, the robot did not hop straight up, 
      and hopped in a completely random direction in each hop, and therefore would often hop
      out of the motion capture system. Having long takes in the motion capture system was important,
      so I spent a lot of time optimizing the gait so that 
      it hops inside the motion capture system.
      <br><br>
      After that my primary project within the lab was to build a quadcopter. The professor wanted to study 
      how mechanical design parameters can be chosen through iteration, through the lens of 
      quadcopter motor positions. So we're going to fly a quadcopter, have a computer analyze 
      the flight and give us new parameters, and repeat with a new chassis. There were three primary
      parts to this project: the hardware, the chassis, and the controller. 
      <br><br>
      The hardware was my first introduction to embedded systems. We used an ESP32-CAM (non
      Aruindo environment) for processing. We
      had typical quadcopter peripherals (IMU, TOF sensors, 
      and speed controllers), which I implemented interfaces for.
      Along with writing firmware, I also assembled a PCB protoboard to tie everything together. 
      <br><br>
      I also designed the chassis for the quadcopter. There were a few requirements: the chassis
      needed to be quick and cheap to reproduce, so it was to be laser cut out of foamcore. It needed to be
      strong - foamcore is very weak. It also needed to have parameterizable motor positions. This proved 
      very difficult, because foamcore is incredibly limiting. 
      <br><br>
      The third part was designing a controller. At this part of the project I learned that I don't really like
      controls. It's not that I don't like challenges - doing the embedded system on the quadcopter was a big
      challenge for me. It was not a standard quadcopter controller. Because we had varying motor positions,
      we could not assume the quadcopter was symmetric. Nor could we assume that the IMU would be at the 
      quadcopter's center of mass. This made designing the controller a huge mathematical challenge. 
      <br><br>
      In my last semester at this lab, I spent my time onboarding new students onto the project.
      I learned important things about how to introduce someone to a project and set them up for success.
      One of the most important things I learned was how to break down a project into digestible parts 
      for someone who may not be as experienced. I found that project roadmaps and concrete starting points 
      were incredibly useful. It was a lot of "here's what I've done, here's where we are going, here 
      are some immediate next steps".

      I worked as an instructional aide (IA) for EECS 464 - Hands on Robotics (HRB). 
      HRB is a senior/graduate ECE elective, where students work in teams to design robots 
      to accomplish various tasks. The class uses Robotis DYNAMIXEL motors, and the primary
      building material is foamcore, so that students can quickly prototype mechanical 
      designs. The last project of the course is to design and build a robot arm that 
      can draw a square on an easel with any orientation.
      <br><br>
      Students are also introduced to a wide range of topics including particle filters,
      PID control, and forward/inverse kinematics. Technical writing through project reports
      is also a big focus throughout the course.
      <br><br>
      I had two primary responsibilities as an IA. I had to make sure that each teams hardware
      (motors and harnessing) was properly working, and that they had enough. I also worked with
      each team to help them laser cut and 3D print parts as needed.
