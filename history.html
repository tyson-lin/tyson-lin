      I am currently working as a systems integration intern at Vayu Aerospace. 
      As a systems integration intern, I help with designing and integrating our electronics
      into the mechanical design of our drones.

      I work under Professor Shai Revzen at the Biologically Inspired Robotics and Dynamical 
      Systems (BIRDS) Lab. The main 
      area of study of our lab is legged locomotion. 
      <br><br>
      My first project was to 3D motion capture data on our hopping robot using Qualysis.
      The math involved in this is beyond me, but the experiment required each leg of the robot
      to have a different spring constant. Because of that, the robot did not hop straight up, 
      and hopped in a completely random direction in each hop, and therefore would often hop
      out of the motion capture system. I spent a lot of time optimizing the gait so that 
      it hops inside the motion capture system.
      <br><br>
      For the past year I have been working with another undergraduate student on a quadcopter 
      (I know that quadcopters don't have legs, but I think the project is really fun and I am learning a 
      lot). We want to study 
      how mechanical design parameters can be chosen through iteration, through the lens of 
      quadcopter motor positions. So we're going to fly a quadcopter, have a computer analyze 
      the flight and give us new parameters, and repeat with a new chassis. 
      <br><br>
      So far, I've designed the paremterized chassis and brought up the hardware. The challenge now
      is to generalize a controller for any set of motor positions. I've built an inverted stewart platform 
      to help with this. With springs instead of hydraulics, it acts as a 6 degree-of-freedom 
      force/torque sensor that lets us quickly calculate the torques and forces each motor applies 
      to the chassis as a function of thrust. 
      <br><br>
      As of January 2023, I don't have any time to work on the project. There is a new team of students
      that will be working on the quadcopter, and I'll be helping them understand what we've done,
      and what generally needs to happen.

        Hands on Robotics

      I worked as an instructional aide (IA) for EECS 464 - Hands on Robotics (HRB). 
      HRB is a senior/graduate ECE elective, where students work in teams to design robots 
      to accomplish various tasks. The class uses Robotis DYNAMIXEL motors, and the primary
      building material is foamcore, so that students can quickly prototype mechanical 
      designs. The last project of the course is to design and build a robot arm that 
      can draw a square on an easel with any orientation.
      <br><br>
      Students are also introduced to a wide range of topics including particle filters,
      PID control, and forward/inverse kinematics. Technical writing through project reports
      is also a big focus throughout the course.
      <br><br>
      I had two primary responsibilities as an IA. I had to make sure that each teams hardware
      (motors and harnessing) was properly working, and that they had enough. I also worked with
      each team to help them laser cut and 3D print parts as needed.
