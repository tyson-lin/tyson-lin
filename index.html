      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        My name is Tyson Lin. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan.
        Having grown up in Honolulu, Hawaii, and as a former competitive swimmer, I love being outdoors and active. 
        My hobbies include beach volleyball, cycling, and hiking. As a Computer Engineer, my interest is more on
        the software side. In future, I hope to obtain a Masters in Computer Science and Engineering and
        eventually work in chip design. I am also a <b>very strong</b> proponent of rubber duck debugging.
